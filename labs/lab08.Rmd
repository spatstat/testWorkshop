This session is concerned with summary statistics for
spacings and interpoint distances.  
The lecturer's R script is [available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spatstat/testWorkshop/master/Scripts/script08.R) (right click and save).

### Exercise 1

For the `swedishpines` data:

1.  Calculate the estimate of the nearest neighbour distance
    distribution function $G$ using `Gest`.

2.  Plot the estimate of $G(r)$ against $r$.

3.  Plot the estimate of $G(r)$ against the theoretical (Poisson) value
    $G_{\mbox{pois}}(r) = 1 - \exp(-\lambda \pi r^2)$.

4.  Define Fisher’s variance-stabilising transformation for c.d.f.’s
    by
    ```{r}
    Phi <- function(x) asin(sqrt(x))
    ```
    Plot the $G$ function using the formula `Phi(.) ~ Phi(theo)`
    and interpret it.


### Exercise 2

For the `swedishpines` data:

1.  Calculate the estimate of the nearest neighbour distance
    distribution function $F$ using `Fest`.

2.  Plot the estimate of $F(r)$ against $r$.

3.  Plot the estimate of $F(r)$ against the theoretical (Poisson) value
    $F_{\mbox{pois}}(r) = 1 - \exp(-\lambda \pi r^2)$.

4.  Define Fisher’s variance-stabilising transformation for c.d.f.’s
    by
    ```{r}
    Phi <- function(x) asin(sqrt(x))
    ```
    Plot the $F$ function using the formula `Phi(.) ~ Phi(theo)`
    and interpret it.
